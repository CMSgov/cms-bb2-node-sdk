# Blue Button 2.0 SDK Development Documentation

## Introduction

This README contains information related to developing the SDK.

It is intended for BB2 team members or others performing SDK development work.

## Development Environment Setup:

### Install node and npm and yarn

npm recommends install node using nvm (node version manager), for install instruction, check out: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm


```
check nvm version:
nvm -v

install node (this also install npm)
nvm install node

check node version
node -v

check npm version
npm -v

install yarn
npm install --global yarn

check yarn version
yarn -v
```

## Developing the SDK

### Installing Development Dependencies

From the repository base directory:

```
yarn install
```

### Running Tests and Linting Code and Generating Ts Docs

From the repository base directory:

```
run tests
yarn test

code linting
yarn lint

generate ts docs
yarn docs
```

## Packaging and Publishing

### Build Package

To build the cms_bluebutton package do the following:

From the repository base directory:

```
build package:
yarn build

generate typescript types:
yarn build:types
```

The resulting distribution files with be created in the `dist/` directory.

### Publish SDK

To publish the sdk, at the base directory of the SDK local repositoriy, run the following npm command:

```
npm publish
```

Note that a package can be published as 'private' in alternative ways, e.g., just run:

```
mkdir my_proj
cd my_proj
npm init --scope=@cms-bluebutton-dev
...
```

This will create a pacakge project 'my_proj' with organization scope (private), or:

```
npm config set init-private true
mkdir my_proj
cd my_proj
yarn init
...
```
Setting npm config global settings will make subsequently created pacakge projects 'private'.

Note that publishing package 'private' is a npm option that requires payment.

### Consuming SDK

1. Consuming from npm registry:

    ```
    mkdir my_proj
    cd my_proj
    yarn init
    yarn add cms-bluebutton-sdk

    continue adding other dependencies, e.g. express, ts-node, etc., ...

    yarn add express @types/express ts-node
    yarn add <other dependencies>
    ```

2. Consuming from a local SDK repository (as a good test before publishing):

    After built and generated typescript types (needed if to be consumed by typescript project), the sdk can be consumed by other projects as shown by below example:

    ```
    mkdir my_proj
    cd my_proj
    yarn init
    yarn add <path to local cms-bluebutton-sdk local repository base directory>

    continue adding other dependencies, e.g. express, ts-node, etc., ...

    yarn add express @types/express ts-node
    yarn add <other dependencies>
    ```
